# ðŸ’³ Consumer Credit Risk Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing consumer credit data to assess the risk of loan default. It applies exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and classification modeling to predict credit risk using key financial indicators.
ðŸ§  Objectives

    Analyze credit-related financial features.

    Identify strong predictors of credit risk.

    Build classification models to predict loan default likelihood.

    Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.
