# Consumer Credit Analysis

## üßæ Consumer Credit Risk Analysis

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of consumer credit data to assess credit risk and predict likelihood of default. It leverages classification modeling techniques to identify high-risk applicants based on key financial and behavioral indicators.

## üîç Objectives

    Explore and understand consumer credit features.

    Identify which variables are most relevant to risk modeling.

    Build a classification model to predict credit risk (e.g., default vs. non-default).

    Evaluate model performance using classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC).
